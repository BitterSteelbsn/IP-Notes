Database - Collection of related Database. Also, a container which holds our data in a logical manner.

DBMS - An organized way of retrieving storing and managing data from a database. It is a software which interacts with the database.

Types of DBMS  
    1. Relational DBMS
    2. Object oriented DBMS
    3. Network DBMS
    4. Hirerarchial DBMS

DBMS architecture
    1. 1-Tier: Application, db server everything running on the same machine
    2. 2-Tier: Basic client-server architecture, where application runs on client side and communicates with db server using db drivers(ex. JDBC)
    3. 3-Tier: Additional layer between client and database. Client->Application Server->Database

    DDL – Data Definition Language
        CREATE
        ALTER
        DROP
        RENAME
        TRUNCATE

        DELETE

    DCL – Data Control Language
        GRANT
        REVOKE

        ROLLBACK– rollbacks a transaction in case of any error occurs.
        SAVEPOINT– sets a savepoint within a transaction.
        SET TRANSACTION– specify characteristics for the transaction.

Instance, Schema, Sub-Schema
    Instance: Snapshot of the database at a particular moment.
    Schema: It is the overall description or the overall design of the database specified during the database design.
    Sub-schema: It can be defined as the subset or sub-level of schema that has the same properties as the schema. ex Views

Different levels of abstraction in DBMS
    1. Physical level
    2. logical level
    3. View level
