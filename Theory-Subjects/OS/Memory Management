In the operating system, the following are four common memory management techniques. 

1. Single contiguous allocation: 
    Simplest allocation method used by MS-DOS. All memory (except some reserved for OS) is available to a process. 

2. Partitioned allocation: 
    --Memory is divided into different blocks or partitions. Each process is allocated according to the requirement. 
    --In Partition Allocation, when there is more than one partition freely available to accommodate a process’s request, 
      a partition must be selected. To choose a particular partition, a partition allocation method is needed. 
      A partition allocation method is considered better if it avoids internal fragmentation. 

    --When it is time to load a process into the main memory and if there is more than one free block of memory of sufficient size then the OS decides which free block to allocate.
      There are different Placement Algorithm:
        A. First Fit: first sufficient block from the top of Main Memory.
        B. Best Fit: first smallest sufficient partition among the free available partition.
        C. Worst Fit: largest sufficient among the freely available partitions available in the main memory.
        D. Next Fit: Next fit is similar to the first fit but it will search for the first sufficient partition from the last allocation point. 
    
3. Paged memory management:
    Memory is divided into fixed-sized units called page frames, used in a virtual memory environment. 

4. Segmented memory management:
    Memory is divided into different segments (a segment is a logical grouping of the process’ data or code).
    In this management, allocated memory doesn’t have to be contiguous. 

***Most of the operating systems (for example Windows and Linux) use Segmentation with Paging. 
A process is divided into segments and individual segments have pages. 

2.1 Contiguous Memory allocation
    --Static Partitioning & Dynamic Partitioning (contiguous memory allocation)

2.3 Non-Contiguous Allocation in Operating System 
    Pros: It has advantage of reducing memory wastage but it increases the overheads due to address translation. 
    It slows the execution of the memory because time is consumed in address translation. 
    -Paging
    -Segmentation

3. Paging in Operating System: ?? physical address space of a process ==kya hai dekho
    Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory. 
    This scheme permits the physical address space of a process to be non – contiguous.

    - Logical Address or Virtual Address (represented in bits): An address generated by the CPU
    - Logical Address Space or Virtual Address Space( represented in words or bytes)(mota mota process size): The set of all logical addresses generated by a program
    - Physical Address (represented in bits): An address actually available on memory unit
    - Physical Address Space (represented in words or bytes)(mota mota main memory size): The set of all physical addresses corresponding to the logical addresses

    The mapping from virtual to physical address is done by the memory management unit (MMU) which is a hardware device and this mapping is known as paging technique.
    --The Physical Address Space is conceptually divided into a number of fixed-size blocks, called frames.
    --The Logical address Space is also splitted into fixed-size blocks, called pages.
    --Page Size = Frame Size

4. Virtual Memory:
    Virtual Memory mainly gives the illusion of more physical memory than there really is with the help of Demand Paging.
